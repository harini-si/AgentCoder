**Role**: As a game tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the game implementation.


### Test Cases for Pygame Game Implementation

#### Game Mechanics



1. **Initialization of Sprites**

   - **Check Player Initialization**
     ```python
     assert isinstance(game.Player, Player), "Player not initialized as an instance of Player class"
     ```



3. **Movement of Player**

   - **Move Left**
     ```python
     initial_x = game.Player.rect.x
     game.Player.move_left()
     assert game.Player.rect.x == initial_x - GRID_SIZE * 2, "Player did not move left by correct amount"
     ```

   - **Move Right**
     ```python
     initial_x = game.Player.rect.x
     game.Player.move_right()
     assert game.Player.rect.x == initial_x + GRID_SIZE * 2, "Player did not move right by correct amount"
     ```


     ```

5. **Game Over Conditions**

   - **No Lives Left**
     ```python
     game.lives = 0
     game.run(pygame.event.Event(pygame.KEYDOWN, {'key': pygame.K_RIGHT}))  # Simulate game loop with no lives left
     assert game.game_over, "Game over not triggered when lives reached 0"
     ```

   - **Restart Game After Game Over**

     ```python
     game.game_over = True
     game.run(pygame.event.Event(pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN, {'button': 1}))  # Simulate game restart
     assert not game.game_over and game.lives == 3 and game.score == 0, "Game did not reset correctly after game over"
     ```

6. **Rendering and Display**

   - **Check Score Display**
     ```python
     game.score = 10
     game.render_game()
     assert pygame.font.Font(None, 36).render(f"Score: {game.score}", True, WHITE), "Score not displayed correctly"
     ```

   - **Check Game Over Message Display**
     ```python
     game.game_over = True
     game.render_game()
     assert pygame.font.Font(None, 36).render("Game Over. Click to play again.", True, WHITE), "Game over message not displayed correctly"
     ```

These test cases aim to cover various aspects of the game mechanics, including initialization, movement of game objects, collision detection, game over conditions, and correct rendering of game elements on the screen. Adjust the specifics of each test case according to the unique mechanics and features of your Pygame-based game.
